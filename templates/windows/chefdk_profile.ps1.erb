# Set HOME to be c:\users\<username>
# chef shell-init relies on `Gem.user_dir` which is $env:HOME on Windows
# If your $env:HOME is a network drive, using gems from a network drive can be very slow
# See https://github.com/chef/chef-dk/issues/374
$env:HOME = $env:USERPROFILE

# let ChefDK set up our environment variables properly
