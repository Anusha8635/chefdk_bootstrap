# Revision History for chefdk_bootstrap

## 0.2.0

* [Remove support for PuTTY](https://github.com/Nordstrom/chefdk_bootstrap/issues/6)
  in favor of using git-provided ssh client.

  PuTTY is difficult to configure and outside the scope of what this cookbook is
  trying to do. Furthermore the Github for Windows client doesn't use PuTTY
  either.

## 0.1.1

* Install git via [git cookbook](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/git)
  instead of [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).

* Install [atom editor](https://atom.io/) via windows_package resource instead
  of chocolatey.

## 0.1.0

* Initial version
